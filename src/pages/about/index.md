Dr. Tiffany Schatz was trained in advanced minimally invasive approaches, with laparoscopic, thoracoscopic, and robotic procedures, as well as minimally invasive work-up of chest masses/lymphadenopathy with EBUS and endoscopy/bronchoscopy. She loves taking care of patients during a time in their lives when things are uncertain or frightening in the setting of illness and need for surgical evaluation and treatment.

Dr. Schatz’s practice focuses on lung cancer and chest masses, paraesophageal hernias, esophageal and GI complaints, palliative surgery, as well as evaluation and treatment of general surgical problems (with special focus on problems that affect the chest, such as substernal goiter).
